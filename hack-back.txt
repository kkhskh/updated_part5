Response to WidgetCo's Hack-Back Request

I would decline WidgetCo's request to destroy the attackers' server, even though I understand their frustration and desire to protect themselves. Several arguments from Patrick Lin's "Ethics of Hacking Back" inform this decision.

First, there's the problem of attribution and collateral damage. While we've successfully reverse engineered the email server and can exfiltrate data, we cannot be certain about who actually owns or operates this server. The attackers might be using a compromised third-party system or cloud infrastructure. Destroying the server could harm innocent parties who own the infrastructure or other users of the system. Lin emphasizes that misattribution in cyberattacks is common, and acting on incomplete information can lead to harming the wrong target.

Second, there's the escalation concern. Lin argues that hack-backs can trigger cycles of retaliation. If we destroy the attackers' server, they might respond with even more damaging attacks against WidgetCo. We would essentially be starting a cyber conflict that could spiral beyond our control. The fact that the attackers "appear to be close to launching a new attack" is speculation, not certainty, and doesn't justify preemptive destruction.

Third, there's the legal problem. Active hack-backs are illegal in most jurisdictions, including the United States under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Even if WidgetCo believes the action is justified, we would be committing crimes that could result in prosecution. Lin points out that vigilante justice, even when seemingly justified, undermines the rule of law.

Fourth, there's the proportionality issue. Lin discusses whether the response is proportionate to the threat. Destroying all data on the server is a severe action that goes beyond simply stopping an immediate threat. It could destroy evidence needed for law enforcement, harm other victims who might have data on that server, or eliminate information that could help identify the attackers.

What I would recommend instead:

1. Document all findings thoroughly and provide them to law enforcement and appropriate government cybersecurity agencies. They have the legal authority and expertise to take appropriate action.

2. Use the exfiltration capability we developed to gather intelligence about the planned attacks, which can help WidgetCo and the other targeted company defend themselves.

3. Work with WidgetCo to improve their security posture so they can better defend against the anticipated attacks rather than trying to preemptively strike.

4. Share threat intelligence with other potential victims through appropriate channels like information sharing organizations.

The exfiltration capability we developed for reconnaissance is more defensible ethically than active destruction. Lin distinguishes between defensive actions and offensive ones, noting that reconnaissance and intelligence gathering for defensive purposes has stronger ethical justification than active attacks.
